# Book Search Engine

## Description

Modern websites are driven by two things: data and user demands. The ability to personalize user data is the cornerstone of real-world web development today. As user demands evolve, applications need to be more performant. This once fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, has been refactored to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.
